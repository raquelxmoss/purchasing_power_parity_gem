## What is Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

If you're selling a digital product\* to a global audience, you are missing out on customers because their purchasing power doesn't go as far as yours.

For example, you've self-published a novel--congratulations!--and you've priced it at USD $20. For someone in the USA, that might be a reasonable expense, but for your readers in, say, Brazil, that might make a big dent in their budget.

Wouldn't it be great if you could price your novel so that it costs your international readers about the same, in real terms, as your readers in the US?

That's what we're trying to achieve here with Purchasing Power Parity.

\* You can definitely calculate PPP for a physical product, but digital products are easier to reason about because the cost of production and distribution is, presumably, the same--you don't have to worry about shipping costs, import taxes, the cost of materials in different locales, etc.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
